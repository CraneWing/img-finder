Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.

User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings

----------------------

I had thought this was a scraping app that will search an existing database out in Webland. However, scraping specifically looks at the DOM ON INVIDUAL PAGES.

What this really is is a custom search based on an API from an existing site. The sample app on Heroku uses Google API and is searching gstatic, which is Google's image data storage. Camper discussions (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/5934) indicate you do NOT have to use only Google. Others are Yahoo, Bing, TinEye and Imgur.

Mongoose module and an image model will be essential. MongoDB needs to maintain a collection (their name for a NoSQL DB) of previous searches that were performed, as there needs to be page that displays the most recent searches.

Google custom search engine

    gcse.type = 'text/javascript';
    gcse.async = true;
    gcse.src = (document.location.protocol == 'https:' ? 'https:' : 'http:') +

Other camper discussions mentioned other APIs that are more generous in search requests. Google is just 100 per day. Others mentioned were Yahoo, Bing, Imgur and TinEye, which had the highest number of free requests.
