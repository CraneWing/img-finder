Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10 and browse recent search queries like this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/. Then deploy it to Heroku.
    Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-back-end-development-projects.
    Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
    User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
    User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
    User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings
    
    Sample JSON object:
